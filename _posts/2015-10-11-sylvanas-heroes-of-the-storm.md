description: "As ranger-general of Silvermoon, it was Sylvanas Windrunner's sworn duty to defend her home against all who would threaten Quel'thalas. She was an accomplished commander and a deadly archer, yet even Sylvanas could not stop the Scourge. Denying her a clean death, the Death Knight Arthas turned Sylvanas into a banshee."
